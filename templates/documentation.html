            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <br>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">Type 2 diabetes (T2D) is a metabolic disorder characterised by several malfunctioning mechanisms around
                 the pathways that regulate the release and action of insulin (Galicia-Garcia et al., 2020). The aetiology
                  of T2D is complex, influenced by genetic, metabolic and environmental factors. The National institute
                   for Health and Care (NICE) estimated more than 5 million people in the UK will be diagnosed with T2D 
                   by 2025 (National Institute for Health and Care Excellence, 2024). Despite these factors, predisposition
                    to T2D may vary across ancestries. For example, T2D can develop around 45 years of age (NIDDK, 2017).
                     However, from further investigation, it was discovered that the South Asian population are known to 
                     develop T2D earlier compared to other populations. </p>
            <br>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">T2D SNP Portal was designed to aid researchers with an accessible, user-friendly and interactive tool
                 for accessing and analysing population genomic data, specifically focusing on Type 2 Diabetes associated 
                 SNPs in South Asian populations. Population genomics data is critical for various fields such as
                  evolutionary biology, genetic epidemiology and precision medicine. By integrating under-studied population
                   datasets, the platform enables users to explore, retrieve and interpret genetic variation related to T2D,
                    facilitating research into disease susceptibility and functional annotations. A dedicated portal for 
                    South Asians allows the identification of disease-associated SNPs through positional mapping and 
                    computational analysis, understanding patient’s responses to certain treatments and environmental factors 
                    (International Human Genome Sequencing Consortium, 2001) that could deduce why the South Asian population 
                    are diagnosed with T2D a decade earlier than other populations (Loh et al., 2022). </p>
            <br>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">The webapp is a streamlined application designed to help users/researchers with the retrieval of limited data
                 and information regarding T2D associated SNPs, specifically focused on the South Asian population – which is
                  an underserved population with sparse data with genetic database online. Recognising this issue, the team
                   developed T2D SNP Portal with the philosophy of creating a user-friendly and interactive platform that 
                   clearly and efficiently communicates the available information in a structured manner for the user
                    to help in research for South Asians. While it’s understood that T2D SNP Portal doesn’t rival or can 
                    replace the more established webapps like Ensemble, T2D Knowledge portal or Uniprot, there is future 
                    potential for scalability to achieve those levels.  </p>

        <!-- Web application features content
        <div id="content2" class="document-section">
            <h2>Web application features</h2>
            <p>Our web application provides the following features:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Feature 1</li>
                <li>Feature 2</li>
                <li>Feature 3</li>
            </ul>
        </div> -->

        <!-- Database construction content -->
        <div id="content2" class="document-section">
            <h2>Database construction</h2>
            <br>
            <p>The need to manipulate large-scale genomic data and store them efficiently, called for 
                creating a Structured Query Language (SQL) database. SQL databases fall under the category
                 of relational databases because they are based on a Relational Database Management System (RDBMS)
                  (w3schools, 2019). Such systems allow for structured and indexed storing of data in tables that
                   are broken down to columns and rows, enabling a specific and separate space for each entry. The 
                   main data populating the database are genetic variants associated to T2D retrieved from Genome
                    Wide Associations Studies (GWAS), meaning it is difficult to handle in terms of both scalability 
                    and time-efficiency. The solution to that is provided by the core of a relational database, 
                    as the implementation of primary and foreign keys on each table allow for quick information 
                    retrieval without iteration through the whole dataset after each user query. A clear primary
                     key establishes relationships between the tables, meanwhile the foreign one allows cross-referencing
                      between the tables in our database, limiting redundancy. Such relations between the tables
                       can be visualized through the database schema, a representation of how tables interact 
                       within the database via primary or foreign keys.  </p>
            <h3>1. Data collection for Statistical analysis</h3>
            <p>Primary data for statistical analysis was obtained via the 1000 genome project website 
                (https://www.internationalgenome.org/) using the wget shell command. The primary data included 
                22 chromosome VCF files downloaded from the ftp server, each containing chromosome number,
                 variant position, rs-ID and the sample IDs that represented an individual’s genotype on that specific position.  </p>
            <p>In addition to the VCF files, the corresponding sample metadata file 
                (integrated_call_samples_v3.20130502.ALL.panel) was also obtained by wget. 
                The file provided detailed population metadata, including population ancestry and
                 superpopulation classification, enabling later filtering for sub-population analysis.</p>
            <p>Using a Bash job script, Bcftools was utilised to filter the sample metadata file, extracting 
                only individuals belonging to the following South Asian (SAS) sub-populations:  Bengali (BEB), 
                Indian (ITU), Punjabi (PJL), and Gujarati (GIH)</p>
            <p>This resulted in four separate files with the sample IDs. These populations were selected because
                 they were the available South Asian groups in both VCF files and the metadata file. The same
                  filtering process was applied to extract European (EUR) samples, which were required for FST statistical comparison. </p>
            <p>After obtaining the filtered sample list, they were used to extract the corresponding
                 individual’s genotype data from the chromosome VCF files. This extraction involved Bcftools 
                 to generate population specific VCF files, ensuring that only variants present in the selected
                  population were retained. The newly filtered VCF files were then subjected to further processing,
                   including the extraction of T2D-assossicated SNPs by cross-referencing with a curated T2D-SNP database.  </p>
            <h3>2. Data collection through API</h2>
            <p>The data regarding SNPs in the database was primarily collected through an Application Programming 
                Interface (API) connection to Genome Wide Association Studies (GWAS). An API is a mechanism that 
                allows two different software to communicate with each other. In this case, API is used as a bridge 
                between the local database and a major genomic repository (GWAS) to retrieve up-to-date genomic information. 
                To access the correct page in GWAS, MONDO_0005148 was retrieved for T2D. The API connection uses an url-link 
                to GWAS (ebi.ac.uk/gwas/rest/api/efoTraits/MONDO_0005148/associations), where the SNPs associated with T2D are 
                presented, and then the acquired page is read as a JSON-file for further parsing in order to remove unnecessary 
                information. Rs-ID, Ensembl accession code, associated p-value and last update date on the datapoint 
                were collected for each SNP entry on the page. In addition, a secondary connection through GWAS API was 
                done to collect location information for each SNP that was originally identified. This connection utilised 
                the previously retrieved rs-ID as part of the url-link (ebi.ac.uk/gwas/rest/api/singleNucleotidePolymorphisms/{rs_id}).
                 From this page, the chromosome and the genomic position information was collected. </p>
            <p>Once the SNP information was collected, the gget package was used to retrieve information regarding 
                the genes that were linked to the SNPs. By using the Ensemble accession code retrieved from GWAS, 
                gget was able to retrieve: the acronym, full name, description, location (including chromosome number, 
                start and end positions) and accession codes for NCBI and Uniprot. </p>
            <p>Alongside the SNP and gene information, the location information in different versions of the human
                 genome were collected. However, due to the discrepancy between the location information in GWAS and
                  1000 genome project, an index table was created to connect the location information of the two 
                  different versions. GWAS uses GRCh38 version of the human genome that was published in 2013, 
                  but 1000 genome project uses the previous version, GRCh37. In different versions, the location 
                  information varies slightly and thus it was important to be able to map the two locations together
                   in relation to the rs-ID. This data retrieval was done by using pyliftover package that 
                   retrieves new location information based on the given old location. Pyliftover is a Python
                    package that works similar way as the online tool, LiftOver, developed by UCSC. </p>
            <h3>3. Automatic updates on the database</h3>
            <p>With the future in mind, the ability to update the database was implemented. Depending on user
                 input, the current date is compared against the date of the last update that is stored in the accessed-table. If the dates do not match, the update will proceed, creating an updated SNP, gene and index tables. If the dates are different, then an update-table will be created, which contains rs-IDs and the last update date from GWAS. After, the rs-IDs and last update dates in ‘update’ and ‘snp-tables’ are compared. If there are differences between the two tables, the old database is deleted, and the new one is generated the same way as mentioned above when creating the database. When updating the gene-table. The updating process can take from few minutes to over an hour. </p>
            <p>With the future in mind, the ability to update the database was implemented. Depending on user input, the current date is compared against the date of the last update, which is stored in the accessed-table. If the dates do not match, the update will proceed further to update snp-, gene- and indexes-tables. First, a temporary update-table will be created, which contains the newest version of rs-IDs and the last update dates from GWAS. The update-table will then be compared to the content of the snp-table. If the contents do not match, the old snp table will be deleted and a new one will be generated the same way as stated above. If the snp-table is updated, the indexes-table will also be fully updated. </p>
            <p>The Ensembl accession codes from new snp-table and the old gene-table are compared in order to identify whether there has been changes on the gene information. If changes are identified, the genes that are not found in the gene-table will be added, same way as described above. The entire updating process can take from few minutes to over an hour and therefore the user has the choice to update the database or just use the older version of it. </p>

        <!-- Population statistics content -->
        <div id="content3" class="document-section">
            <h2>Statistical Analusis</h2>
            <h3>1. Stats test development</h3>
            <p>The web application provides useful and insightful information into the evolutionary significance of the T2D-associated SNPs. In population genetics, selection statistics are used to assess whether certain genomic regions have been subjected to natural selection. Tajima’s D and Fixation index (FST) were selected as the clearest measures to identify patterns of natural selection.  </p>
            <h3>2. Genetic Differentiation</h3>
            <p>A common approach to explain evolutionary influences between populations is counting their genetic differentiation. The statistic to measure that is Fixation Index (FST), as it measures population differentiation in terms of genetic structure, quantifying genetic variance between two populations (Nagylaki, 1998). A score of 0 indicates that the two areas measured are identical and a score of 1 indicates complete separation and no shared alleles between population (Khan et al., 2021). Generally, a high FST value indicates a high level of differentiation, indicating limited gene flow and strong population structure, which suggests positive selection. On the other hand, a low value indicates shared genetic variation amongst the population. Simply, it measures how allele frequencies diverge among populations relative to the total genetic variance. This is explained as genes are influenced by genetic selection and drift.  </p>
            <p>The webapp follows the standard approach of estimating FST using SNPs, focusing on four South Asian communities, using a European population as the comparison group for FST, as that is the group with the most readily available datasets. The webapp compares each population and each chromosome against the European population for the clearest indicators of where the genetic differentiation is occurring. FST is chosen as it can detect loci influenced by selection when comparing two populations, lending insight into evolutionary change. </p>
            <h3>3. Neutrality </h3>
            <p>Tajima’s D measures neutrality within a population by comparing two randomly chosen DNA sequences and averaging differences between the pairs of sequences (Thornton, 2005). This test can differentiate between DNA sequences that have evolved neutrally or due to an outside influence. A negative value, especially <-2 or below, indicates recent positive selection, whereas a higher value would indicate the maintenance of multiple alleles. The analyses are carried per chromosome for each population to more accurately identify where positive selection may be occurring. Additionally, the team chose to calculate Tajima’s D in sliding windows of 10,000 base pairs (Holmudden et al., 2024), which is standard, to capture more meaningful allele frequency patterns, enhancing statistical reliability and not demanding too much computational force. </p>
            <h3>4. Data manipulation and statistical calculations </h3>
            <p>Once the data had been processed, as explained earlier in data collection, the statistical analyses could proceed. For the FST calculations, job scripts automated the process. This approach is efficient and uses loops to streamline analyses within the HPC cluster. Within the script, the bcftools module is loaded to index and merge VCF files. Subsequently, the vcftools module is loaded to analyse the data and calculate FST values, allowing for meaningful population genetic comparisons. Similarly, to calculate Tajima D, the HPC cluster was used to employ a different jobscript, loop through each chromosome in 10,000 base pair windows for each population. These produced precalculated values that can be plotted and presented to the user, eliminating the need to manually open extremely large VCF files and then complete calculations based on user input, which takes significantly longer. Instead, the user can input a selected genomic region and the webapp retrieves the specific information for that region.  </p>
            <p>Initially the GoogleDrive API was integrated into the webapp as the GitHub repository was unable to store such large data files. However, this proved to be slower than required of a webapp. Instead, once these calculations were complete, they were added to the database, indexed and subsequently used in the webapp for data retrieval. This is a much more efficient and user friendly. User input was important to consider as it is extremely useful to the user to be able to see more detailed information in a particular region than just to be able to see precalculated values over a whole chromosome which gives very nonspecific information, making the webapp less useful. Matplotlib was use and the style of plot chosen was scatter plots as visually they are easy to understand and visually clear.  </p>
