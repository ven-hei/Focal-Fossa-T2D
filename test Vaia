Checklist for the Group Project:
1) Ensure that you understand the software requirements and sketch out some kind of architecture for the software (i.e. what components are needed and how they should interact)
2) Determine which data and technologies you need to produce the software
3) Find out enough about the data and technologies so that you can approximate how long the different parts of project will take, and who in your team is best suited to complete them
4) Agree on the optimal way of working together to complete the project
5) Identify any specific new skills that need to be learned by team members
6) Produce a development plan (e.g. Gantt chart) for the duration of the project, detailing the various tasks and who will be responsible for them
